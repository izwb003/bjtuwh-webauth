# bjtuwh-webauth

Automatic webauth shellscript for bjtuwh web.wlan.bjtu network.

Currently it contains two Linux shellscript that use curl command to automatically send a POST request to 10.255.240.99 auth page that you can make your custom change later - to make some devices automatically connects to the school wifi network.

I want to build an OpenWRT .ipk package that automatically auth the router to make a router connects to the school network. I'm still learning about OpenWRT development now. Will make changes later.
